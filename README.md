I am Mohammad Lashkari, a master of computer science minor in soft computing and artificial intelligence graduated from Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic). I am interested in generalization performance analysis of neural networks, stability of optimization algorithms in deep learning, contextualized word representation in natural language processing, unsupervised learning, handling missing values, and detecting outliers.
